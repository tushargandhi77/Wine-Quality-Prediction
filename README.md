## Overview
This Streamlit application is designed to predict the quality of wine based on several features. Users can input values for various attributes of the wine, and the app will generate a prediction of the wine quality on a scale from 1 to 10.

## Features
The following features are used for predicting the wine quality:
- **Alcohol**: The alcohol content of the wine.
- **Sulphate**: The amount of sulphates present in the wine.
- **Volatile Acidity**: The amount of acetic acid in the wine, which contributes to its volatile nature.
- **Sulphur Dioxide**: The level of sulphur dioxide present in the wine, which acts as a preservative.
- **Density**: The density of the wine, which is related to its sugar content and alcohol concentration.

## Usage
To run the app locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the app files.
4. Run the Streamlit app using the command `streamlit run app.py`.
5. Access the app in your web browser at the provided URL.

Once the app is running, you can input values for the wine features using the provided input fields. After entering the desired values, click the "Predict" button to generate a prediction of the wine quality.

## Model
The prediction model used in this app is trained on a dataset of wine samples with corresponding quality ratings. The model is built using machine learning techniques to predict wine quality based on the provided features.
